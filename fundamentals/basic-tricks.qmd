## `range()`, `list()`, and `[]`

`range()` creates a `range` object. `[range(0, 10)]` will create a `list` object with the `range` object inside of it, but if you were expecting `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`, that's not what you'll get. To get that, do `list(range(0, 10))`.

## List comprehension

`result = [i for i in range(0, 10)]` is equivalent to

```
result = []

for i in range(0, 10):
  result.append(i)
```

This can be extended with conditions. For example,

```
result = [i for i in range(0, 10) if i % 2 == 0]
```

is equivalent to

```
result = []

for i in range(0, 10):
  if i % 2 == 0:
    result.append(i)
```

To create a list in reverse order, use a negative step: `ten_to_one = list(range(10, 0, -1))`.
