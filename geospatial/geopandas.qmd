## Overview

Geopandas is a Python package for working with vector data.

[Official documenation](https://geopandas.org/en/stable/docs/user_guide.html)

Overlays accomplish set operations.
Dissolve accomplishes aggregation.

## This

```
import geopandas as gpd
```

## Reading data


Note: The Fiona package has a function to list the layers in an Esri geodatabase. It is `fiona.listlayers("path/to/my-esri.gdb")`. This is nice because `gpd.read_file()` allows reading in a layer from an Esri geodatabase by name (in addition to positional reference). Example:

```
layer_names = fiona.listlayers("path/to/my-esri.gdb")
print(layer_names)

# Let "land_use" be the name of one of the feature classes in the geodatabase

land_use = gpd.read_file(
  "path/to/my-esri.gdb", 
  driver = "FileGDB", 
  layer = "land_use"
)
```

## `GeoSeries` objects

## `GeoDataFrame` objects

<!-- 
Is a GeoDataFrame simply the child of Pandas and Shapely?

It seems a GeoDataFrame is a Pandas `DataFrame` object with a special column that is type `GeoSeries`.
-->

Let `gdf` be a `GeoDataFrame` object. `gdf.total_bounds` will return the minimum x-value, minimum y-value, maximum x-value, and maximum y-value (in that order). These can be unpackaged as

```
x_min, y_min, x_max, y_max = gdf.total_bounds
```
