But with an axis definition, we can zoom to a specific area. (This is especially helpful for working with geospatial data.)\nTo do this, use plt.axis(). Example:\na = [0, -100, 25, 67, -323]\nb = [0, 3, 7, 3, 9]\nLooking at the data, we can see that we have a one-to-many situation, and this line is going to traverse backwards and create a triangle. (Etch A Sketch?)\nLet’s zoom in on the triangle. To do so, use plt.axis(), and provide the x-axis limits and y-axis limits. The limits for both are min and max:\nplt.axis([-50, 80, 2, 8])\nplt.plot(a, b)\nTo finish it off, add a title and label the axes:\nplt.title(\"Triangle\")\nplt.xlabel(\"a\")\nplt.ylabel(\"b\")\nplt.axis([-50, 80, 2, 8])\nplt.plot(a, b)\nIt’s clear that all plot configurations should precede the call to plt.plot().\nAnother cool thing is overriding the tick labels:\nplt.xticks((-40, -20, 0, 20, 40, 60, 80), (\"h\", \"e\", \"l\", \"l\", \"o\", \"o\", \"o\"))\nNote: plt.*ticks() uses tuples and not lists.\nTo specify that the line should be colored red, add color = \"red\" to plt.plot().

    "text": "Jupyter Notebooks\nA Jupyter Notebook has two modes: Edit Mode and Command Mode.\nIt’s helpful to think as Command Mode being the default mode because of the keyboard shortcuts that are used to toggle between them. The Enter key will allow you to enter edit mode, while the Esc key will allow you to escape edit mode.\n\nCommand mode\nThe structure of a Jupyter Notebook can be built out with or without the mouse. My personal preference is to remove reliance on the mouse and clicking buttons, which allows my hands to stay on the keyboard.\nA cell is always selected (highlighted). The simplest thing you can do is change which cell is selected. This can be accomplished by pressing ↑ (to move up one cell) and ↓ (to move down one cell). In Command Mode, movement is cell-by-cell (in contrast to what these same keys do when in Edit Mode).\nNew cells can be added relative to the currently selected cell. To add a new cell, press a (for above) or b (for below).\nMultiple cells can be selected with Shift + &uparrow and Shift + ↓. Cells can also be copy–pasted or cut–pasted. To copy a cell, press C. To cut a cell, press X. To paste a copied or cut cell, press V. Note: The cell will be pasted below the selected cell.\nOne or more cells can be deleted with a sequence of two presses of D. (Think of the first press as yielding “Are you sure?” and the second press as answering “Oh, I’m sure—sure I won’t regret this at all”.)\nSelected cells of the same type can also be merged with Shift + M. To split a cell into two cells, press Ctrl + Shift + -. The cursor position dictates how the cell is split. Everything before the cursor stays as-is and everything after the cursor gets moved to the new cell.\nTo scroll up the notebook, press Shift + Space. To scroll down, simply press Space.\n\nCell types\nBy default, new cells will be code cells. To change a code cell to a Markdown cell, press M (for Markdown). To change a Markdown cell back to a code cell, press Y.\nIf the Markdown cell has a header line, 1, 2, …, 6 can be used to change it. If the Markdown cell has multiple header lines, only the first one will be affected. There is nothing wrong with having multiple header lines, but there is an arguable advantage to putting sections in their own cells as the nesting of sections can be updated without going into Edit Mode and manually adding or removing one or more #.\n\n\nPreferences\nTo toggle line numbers on or off, press Shift + L. Line numbers are relative to the code cell.\n\n\n\nEdit mode\nEdit mode is for writing and running code. The focus here is on capabilities around running code.\nWhen you’ve entered Edit Mode, there are a few common things to do.\nThere are three keyboard chords for running code, and they all include Enter. To run the selected cell, press Ctrl + Enter. This escapes Edit Mode automatically, but keeps that cell selected. To run the selected cell but automatically select the next one, use Alt + Enter. To run the selected cell and insert a new cell and stay in Edit Mode, press Shift + Enter.\nIf you need to display help for an object, postfix it with ?, e.g. print?.\nTo comment the line where the cursor is positioned, press Ctrl + /. The same chord can be used to uncomment the line.\n\nTo cover\n\nIt seems clicking to the left of a cell collapses it. When navigating in the direction of a collapsed cell and reaching it, it is skipped.\nThe table of contents can be shown with Ctrl + Shift + K, but this can also be accomplished by clicking the TOC tab (left side of the interface).\n\n\n\nMagic commands (ooh, ahh!)\nTo see all available magic commands, run %lsmagic in a code cell. The primary language can be overridden in a cell with magic. For example, you can create a Bash cell with %%bash, a cell to input and render HTML with %%HTML, and a cell to write \\(\\LaTeX\\) with %%latex.\n\n\n\nThe Command Palette\nTODO: Cover anything useful about the Command Palette"
